  # Deliberately no `auto_updates true`.
  #
  # That stanza tells Homebrew an app installs its own updates and to keep out of the
  # way. grrclone does not: it can be asked to *check* GitHub for a new release, but
  # it never replaces its own bundle. Claiming otherwise would make `brew upgrade`
  # skip a copy nothing else updates.
